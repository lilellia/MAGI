    <h1>MAGI Summary</h1>

    <h2>I: The Past Chases the Present</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="./characters/amara-minori.md">Amara Minori</a>, our narrator and protagonist, wakes up from a nightmare
        early in the morning. Staring in the mirror, she activates her Maiden transformation before collapsing in grief
        and anguish. A few hours later, she heads to school, where she's distracted and even more distant than usual.
        The boy sitting next to her in class, <a href="./characters/molva-atris.md">Molva Atris</a>, takes note and
        joins her on the school for lunch, where she eventually reveals that one year ago, to the day, her best friend,
        <a href="./characters/calleni-nia.md">Calleni Nia</a>, died. Trying to help her put a positive spin on the day,
        he invites her to the picnic that he and his younger sister, <a href="./characters/molva-iselle.md">Iselle</a>,
        are planning to have after school.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the time the school day ends, she has decided to go with them, meeting Iselle in her classroom for the first
        time before they leave for the picnic. Because Minori is such an enigma, having transferred to their school and
        having never spoken about her past, Iselle decides to ask about it and, to their surprise, Minori decides to
        answer, revealing that Nia was killed in a <a href="./events/siel-shopping-center-incident.md">terrorist
            attack</a> only minutes after the two had parted ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, she gets a phone call from <a href="./characters/kaskei-ari.md">Kaskei Ari</a>, her former handler
        from when she worked for the military's Magical Combat Assist unit. Ari informs her of a planned attack at the
        train station near her in just over half an hour, insisting that she is the only one he trusts to stop it from
        happening. As her emotions (and magical power) flow through her, the power also flows through her keystone
        necklace that Iselle is holding. To both girls' surprise, Iselle can sense this power, though she can't identify
        it. But without time to explain, Minori rushes off to the train station.
    </p>

    <h2>II: Same, Yet Different</h2>

    <p>
        Minori approaches the station, activating her powers (but not her transformation) as she nears it. There, Ari
        tells her how his official orders are to ignore the threat, but it's something that neither he nor Minori are
        willing to ignore. Eventually, she finds the suspect with a backpack full of explosives, temporarily disables
        them, and detains the suspect until Ari arrives to take him away. He tries to make conversation with her, but
        she can see through to his implied desire for her to rejoin the unit and her subsequent coldness turns the
        conversation quiet and awkward, though she agrees to be kept up to date on his investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        After Ari has left, Minori releases her powers and returns to the train station, having decided on a whim to
        return back to Siel, where she lived before transferring to Irèle. There, she wanders the streets before finding
        herself in front of a flower shop, deciding to buy a bouquet of flowers to take to Nia's grave. To her surprise,
        Nia's younger sister, <a href="./characters/calleni-rena.md">Rena</a>, is also at the cemetery, and she invites
        Minori over for dinner. After Minori's short conversation with a copy of Nia in her head, she goes with Rena,
        and the two reconnect after their long separation, eventually promising to maintain closer contact going
        forward. In particular, Rena reveals that she's joined her middle school's choir club and invites Minori to the
        upcoming recital.
    </p>


    <h2>III: A New Confidante</h2>
    <p>
        The next morning, Minori (back in Irèle) goes to Iselle's classroom looking for her. When the younger student
        shows up, Minori asks her to join her on the roof for lunch that day, intending to both determine Iselle's
        Maidenship and to (embarrassedly) express her interest in spending more time together. Iselle agrees.
    </p>
    <p>
        In her own classroom, she apologizes to Atris for running off the day before, giving a
        technically-true-but-misleading explanation for her departure. At lunch, she rejects his offer to join her,
        insisting that today, she needs the empty space. Before Iselle arrives on the roof, Minori is cast back to four
        years prior, when she first found out that she was a Maiden, reexperiencing the confusion and uncertainty before
        she learned the truth about her powers.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Iselle arrives, Minori keeps her promise to herself to ask the younger student to spend more time together
        before bringing the subject to the important matter at hand, testing Suzuko's sensitivity to the flow of magic,
        which only other Maidens can passively detect. Unsurprisingly, she passes these tests, and after Minori ensures
        that this will stay a secret between them, she activates her full transformation, casting a soundproof ward
        around them. Iselle is understandably confused and frightened as Minori begins explaining that they are both
        Maidens.
    </p>

    <p>
        When she learns that her powers are still sealed (and only other Maidens can unseal them), she asks if Minori
        will do so, though Minori refuses, saying

        <blockquote>
            I could. I'm not going to, though. At least, not yet. [...] If I were to unseal you, I'd have to report it,
            and it feels like there's something big starting to happen, especially around the agency. Don't know what,
            yet, but you'd end up dragged into the ensuing whirlwind, and you don't want that, trust me.
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        As justification for this decision, Minori cites the hardships she's endured as a member of the MCA forces and
        says that after Nia's death, she left the MCA and her magical powers, looking for a normal life, but even then,
        it caught up to her, and she doesn't feel comfortable putting anyone else through that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iselle, somewhat understanding, attempts to console her, promising to do her best to at least give Minori a more
        normal social life with a new friend. She gives her a piece of paper with her phone number on it, insisting that
        they address each other using their first names as Minori's first training exercise (though they do maintain
        their normal honorifics).
