        <b>Aimaéri</b> is the name of a historical preservation site and public park in Tinène, Clerèssia. The name also refers specifically to the chapel at the core of the castle.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
        Records indicate that the area now known as Aimaéri was first settled some time during the first grand cycle, likely before <span class="tooltip">1:14:1<span>absolute year 170</span></span>.
        At that time, it was merely a few houses surrounding a central chapel. Though the settlement would eventually grow to be the city of Tinène—originally named Ithinèn—the chapel was named Aimaéri,
        meaning "home" or "sanctuary" in old Clerèssian.
    </p>

    <p>
        The chapel's stained glass display—a large mural of the ocean scene—dates to the end of the first grand cycle. It is believed to have been added around the year <span class="tooltip">1:22:9<span>absolute year 282</span></span>.
        According to legend, it was created by the goddess Neyu as a symbol of gratitude toward her followers; however, sources disagree about the details of this event, raising doubt to its validity. The modern consensus seems to be that
        Neyu did not create the display but, rather, blessed it. (It is also possible for both to be true if, for example, she imparted divine inspiration into its physical creator.)
    </p>

    <p>
        By the fourth grand cycle, the area had grown substantially, and a small castle had been built for the local lords. Because of its location (far from Clerèssia's borders with Ascia and Turréli and on the Gulf of Syprén), the
        castle was established as a defensive fortification, and the nation's monarchs could safely retreat there should the need ever arise. This has occurred only once, from <span class="tooltip">5:13:12 Fis 31<span>1364.133</span></span>
        to <span class="tooltip">Neyu 02 of the same year<span>1364.308</span></span> when King Ressa III and Queen Lynna escaped from the then-capital Kýo to Tinène during the Turréli invasion.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the Clerèssian monarchy was disestablished on <span class="tooltip">7:1:1 Sirelle 01<span>1795.001</span></span>, the castle and surrounding area were converted into a historical preservation site and public park.
        The chapel still stands at the core of the castle, and the site as a whole draws a large tourist population, especially during summer and winter breaks.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern Day</h2>

    <p>
        Despite its status as a historical preservation site, Aimaéri is not known for having any additional level of monitoring or security. Though guided tours and similar events can be arranged, it is more common for visitors
        to simply explore the area on their own, and the area is only occasionally surveilled. This is in accordance with Tinène's founding creed of accommodating others' needs without hesitation. This high level of altrustic,
        others-first philosophy has waned over time as other philosophies, such as individualism and modernism, have emerged over the millennia, but given the area's identity as a historical site—and one centered on an ancient
        chapel—the government and citizens have chosen to continue to apply a historical lens to the area.

        On <span class="tooltip">7:17:12 Fis 19<span>2014.121</span></span>, <a href="../characters/amara_minori.html">Amara Minori</a> unsealed the powers of <a href="../characters/molva_iselle.html">Molva Iselle</a>. In addition,
        water-goddess Neyu—having imbued the stained glass display with a portion of her soul—imbued Iselle with some of her own power, deflecting Minori's gratitude for the gesture. This allows Iselle, a water Maiden, to grow her
        own skills more quickly and readily.

    <h2>Trivia</h2>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The name <i>Aimaéri</i> derives from a portmanteau of the Japanese <ruby>ただいま<rt style="font-style:italic;">tadaima</rt></ruby> and <ruby>おかえり<rt style="font-style:italic;">okaeri</rt></ruby>.
                These are commonly-used expressions with understood meanings along the lines of "I'm back" and "Welcome back". This is a reference to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA6vJg0Rl14">live stream
                    by Hololive VTuber Nekomata Okayu on February 15–16, 2021 (JST)</a>, in which she played indie platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/" style="font-style: italic;">Jump King</a>.
                    Being a rage game in the same vein as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/" style="font-style: italic;">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</a>, it features a
                    large amount of precision platforming where one mistake can send the player a long distance downward. The final segment of the game consists of a chapel, an icy area, and a tower climb.
                    Because of the level design, a player who falls during the difficult ice or tower sections will fall back into the chapel but (thankfully) no further downward. During the final three or four hours of her
                    stream, Okayu repeatedly fell into the chapel many dozens of times, and her saying ただいま and/or the chat saying おかえり became something of a running joke.
