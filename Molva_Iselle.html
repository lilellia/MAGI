    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <p>
        Iselle is a bundle of energy. She has always had a very close relationship with <a href="./Molva_Atris.html">her
            brother</a> growing up, and they are both eager to reconnect after the year they were apart going to schools
        in different cities; by contrast, <a href="./Molva_Natalia.html">her older sister</a> has always distanced
        herself from the two, especially given the large age gap between them. Despite this, Iselle admires and respects
        her sister's dedication despite her relative unpopularity.
    </p>

    <p>
        When <a href="./Amara_Minori.html">Amara Minori</a> learns that Iselle has untapped and previously-unknown
        magical abilities, she quickly tells
        her in order to prevent the younger girl from the confusion and fear that she'd experienced in unlocking her own
        powers.
    </p>

    <p>
        She is motivated by honor, loyalty, and friendship, and she is drawn to Minori's duty to protect those less
        powerful than herself. Her goal is to bring happiness to as many people as she possibly can.
    </p>

    <!-- APPEARANCE -->
    <h2>Appearance</h2>

    <p>
        When not wearing the Irèle High School uniform, she prefers to wear cute or otherwise fashionable outfits, and
        she puts a noticeable effort into her appearance.
    </p>

    <h3>Gown</h3>
    <p>
        Her magical Gown consists of a translucent teal-blue dress atop a white strapless bandeau bra and shorts. The
        dress's
        skirt reaches to her mid-thigh, colored with streaks of lighter blues and whites that give the garment a sense
        of depth and motion; the underworn shorts come a few centimeters short of the skirt's hem. During her full
        transformation, her hair shimmers, turning from its normal blue-green to a bright, pale blue, though she can
        repress this effect as well.
    </p>

    <!-- RELATIONS -->
    <h2>Relationships</h2>

    <h3>
        Family
    </h3>
    <p>
        Iselle has two older siblings: Natalia (sister) and Atris (brother). Natalia was eleven when Iselle was born,
        and this age gap was difficult for the sisters to overcome, which wasn't aided by Natalia's general lack of
        interest in fostering relationships with her family. In fact, Natalia's success at nearly everything she touched
        made it impossible for Iselle to follow in her footsteps, an expectation unfairly leveled at her by her parents
        and other family members (apart from Atris, who was generally exempted from these comparisons on account of
        being a boy). In Atris's words:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        [Iselle's] fourteen, but since Natalia-ren's so much older, our parents tend to forget that she's not, like, six
        by comparison. As the two girls, they get compared a lot, something I was lucky enough to avoid most of the
        time. Natalia-ren set the bar so impossibly high in so many ways, and being held to those same standards, even
        as an anchor, has been really hard on Isa. Especially when she gave up trying to follow in her footsteps and
        just become her own person. [...T]here's always been a tension between her and Natalia-ren, though Isa usually
        tries to downplay it. She won't admit it, but now that she has the option not to be home for Natalia-ren's
        birthday—a celebration of the unchosen rival she could never hope to beat—she's definitely excited to take it.
        (Chapter V).
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        By contrast, Iselle describes her and Atris as "inseparable"; Atris calls them "undeniably close" and calls
        Iselle his “best friend”. This likely stems from Atris's favorable treatment of her growing up in a home that
        wasn't always as welcoming as she might have preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
        No specific information is known about her parents or other family beyond what can be inferred via her
        relationship with Natalia.

    <p>
        As a Maiden, she specializes in support (ally buff/enemy debuff) and healing, preferring to attack from a
        distance. She struggles in close-range/melee combat, though she can use her staff as a makeshift shield against
        some attacks, and she carries a small dagger in the left boot of her Gown. Though she specializes in support,
        she also possesses relatively strong offensive magic as well, though it exhausts her comparatively quickly.

    <h2>
        Trivia
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Her family name comes from the Russian word <ruby>королева<rp>(</rp>
                <rt>koroleva</rt>
                <rp>)</rp>
            </ruby>, meaning "queen". She controls water magic, so there is a loose association chain between
            <i>water</i> → <i>rain</i> → <i>reign</i> (homophone) → <i>queen</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Her given name is of unknown origin.<a class="ref" href="https://nameberry.com/babyname/Iselle">(Source)</a>
            but could be related to names such as Isabelle. It resembles the name of Isolde Ennets, deuteragonist of
            <i>Elena</i>, another of Lily Ellington's books. In particular, both characters are deuteragonists who share
            the nickname Isa. That Iselle's family name is a corruption of "queen" is also a reference to Isolde being a
            princess of her home nation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Her favorite animal is the otter, a fact alluded to by her codename.

            Character appearance references:
            <ul>
                <li>Her general appearance is inspired by <a class="tooltip" href="./charref/molva-iselle-01.png">this

                </li>


                <li>
                    Her Gown is inspired by <a class="tooltip" href="./charref/molva-iselle-02.jpg">this
                        dress<span><img width="500" src="./charref/molva-iselle-02.jpg" /></span></a>, sold <a

                    Obviously, that's a lot more translucent than Iselle could wear on its own (which bespeaks its
                    existence as lingerie), hence the white bra and shorts. Her dress's skirt reaches just past her
                    mid-thigh (which is a bit longer than in the reference image).
                </li>

                <li>The way her hair shimmers in her transformation is reminiscent of <a class="tooltip"

            Origin of spell names:

            <ul>

                <li>
                    <!-- Echoes -->
                    <i>Echoes</i> — refers to the amplification or reduplication of the magical energy caused by the
                    spell,
                    much as a sonic echo is a reduplication of sound waves. The name also references the <i>Healing
                        Echo</i>
                    class of skills known by <a href="https://atelier.fandom.com/wiki/Jessica_Philomele">Jessica
                        Philomele</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_Khemia:_Alchemists_of_Al-Revis">
                        <i>Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis</i>
                    </a>. As the names suggest, <i>Healing Echo</i> are healing skills, allowing Jess to restore her
                    party members' HP in battle or in the field, rather than MGK boosting skills (as is <i>Boost</i>:
                    ATK+/MGK+).　It is, perhaps, worth noting that Jess is contracted with the Mana of Wind, rather than
                    water—no Mana of Water appears in the game.

                <!-- Sension -->
                <li>
                    <i>Sension</i> — It phonetically resembles the Japanese word <ruby>船長<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>senchō</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby> ("captain [of a ship]"). Sino-Japanese kanji readings give <ruby>千<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>sen</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby> ("thousand": <ruby>二千<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>nisen</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2000, etc.) and <ruby>鳥<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>chō</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby> ("bird"); however, these have native readings of <ruby>千<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>chi</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby> and <ruby>鳥<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>tori</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby>, respectively. These two kanji form the word <ruby>千鳥<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>chidori</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby> ("thousand birds"), which is a name that appears throughout Japanese literature and
                    drama, including as the name of Etou Kanami's okatana in <i>Toji no Miko</i>. This also ties a loose
                    wind-element reference (birds&sim;wind), fitting the fact that this spell is taught to her by Aya.
