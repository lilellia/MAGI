    <h1>
        Elemental Harmonics Theory
    </h1>

    <p>
        Elemental Harmonics Theory is a paradigm originated by the Fae that
        describes how different types of elements interact.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        The theory states that the different magical elements—such as fire and
        water—each has its own set of characteristics and qualities that affect
        how the magic performs and how it interacts with magic of the same or
        different elements. As such, while spells of different elements may be
        used to accomplish the same type of effect, the relative ease or effectiveness
        of the spells may differ purely based on their elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, <a href="Amara_Minori.html">Snow Leopard</a>'s <i>Alsýon</i>
        (ice element) and <a href="Miú_Aya.html">Crimson Wolf</a>'s <i>Kora</i>
        (wind element) both serve to facilitate secret communication, though they
        do so in very different fashions: Alsýon obstructs sound waves such that
        sound cannot penetrate or escape the spell's effect boundary; Kora
        transmits thoughts-as-sound telepathically over a short distance. Though
        both spells accomplish their tasks by semi-physically affecting sound
        waves, the methods by which this is done speak to the broad characteristics
        of the elements: ice tends to be quiet, restrictive, insular, and internal;
        wind tends to be better described as flowing, external, transversal.

    <h2>
        Applications to Maidens
    </h2>

    <p>
        While the Fae are capable of using spells from different elements and disciplines
        quite readily, the difficulty and high-energy cost of creating the Maidens in the
        first place mean that they are generally proficient in only a single element,
        though a select few have been able to demonstrate command of multiple elements
        after intense study and training. Due to the Maidens' monoelemental nature, the
        Elemental Harmonics Theory is sometimes applied to the girls themselves and the
        interactions of their personalities.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Controversy
    </h3>

    <p>
        However, while there's some consensus that the root theory is functionally supported, this
        corollary is often considered pseudoscience by its nonbelievers as in the same vein as astrology:
        it's reductionary—taking the true complexity of the world and oversimplifying it—and it seeks
        to find patterns where none truly exist, or where there's enough variation (or the parameters
        are vague enough) to support the predictions on their own.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, it <i>is</i> true that Snow Leopard (ice) and <a href="Molva_Iselle.html">Blue Otter</a>
        (water) get along extremely well and are highly compatible in both their personalities and magical powers,
        which is supported by the close interplay between their elements. Similarly, Snow Leopard and
        <a href="Koyo_Gwynne.html">Black Swan</a> (fire) find much more challenge in their relationship,
        just as water and fire are said to be quite distant. Additionally, it's not hard to see Snow Leopard
        herself as distant and insular, her passions level-headed and moderated; Blue Otter is a gentle and
        inclusive soul, adaptive, and embodying a warmth to those around her; Black Swan is a highly
        energetic girl who prefers quick, instinctive decisions—and all of these characteristics are
        explained by the girls' elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other hand, though, Snow Leopard also shows a fun, playful side and strong external leadership—neither
        of which is generally associated with ice. Likewise, Blue Otter is seen to possess a manipulative, almost
        passive-aggressive cleverness, and even if she rarely uses it, that is more closely associated with wind
        and ice. And much of Black Swan's preference for instinct is due to her low self-confidence and tendency
        to get stuck in her own head when making decisions, which is not a fire-element trait either.
    </p>

    <p>
        Skeptics of the theory would argue that the true reason behind Snow Leopard's and Black Swan's incompatibility
        is not in the origins of their magic, but in this fundamental difference in how they approach problems, just
        as two nonmagical people would struggle to work together if they couldn't even agree on whether or not
        to have a plan. Proponents would argue that this is (at least partially) encoded by their associated
        elements, that there is an interplay between Maidens' personalities and their magical element: Snow Leopard
        is an ice-element Maiden because her personality embodies certain aspects of the ice element, and these
        connections are strengthened by the magic itself—that is, they'd agree that the reason for the relational
        difficulty between Snow Leopard and Black Swan is their opposite approaches to problem-solving, but that
        this is by no means separate from (and may well be informed by) the fact that they are Maidens of opposing elements.
