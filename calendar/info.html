    <h1>Calendar System</h1>

    <p>
        Let the planetary orbital period (solar year) be 312.311 local days long, and let the moon's orbital period be
        34.397 local days long. This creates a balance of 9.106... lunar cycles per solar year. If we let the calendar
        consist of nine months, this gives nine months of 34 days (306 total) with six or seven intercalendary days.
    </p>

    <p>
        We name these ten periods as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Sirelle</li>
            <li>Tiri</li>
            <li>Enna</li>
            <li>Fis</li>
            <li>Klesni</li>
            <li>Pelio</li>
            <li>Kria</li>
            <li>Sui</li>
            <li>Brilia</li>
            <li>Neyu</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        These names originate as names of gods from the ancient mythology. Neyu was an organizer whose role was to bring
        together the bickering gods and be a watcher over humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
        What we observe is that 312.311 = 312 + 4/13 + 1/302.32..., meaning that we want four leap years per cycle of 13
        years, which we can achieve with a pattern of "SSL SSL SSL S". After 13 years, 4060.043 days have passed, and
        this calendar yields 4060 days in that period, making this system only 0.043 = 1/23.2... days short, meaning
        that the calendar is short one full day after 23 cycles (299 years). In this case, the 23rd cycle can simply
        include one extra day, making the pattern "SSL SSL SSL SSL L" for that cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
        After one grand cycle (299 years), a total of 93380.989 days have passed, and the calendar yields 93381,
        meaning that the calendar ends up a day <i>ahead</i> after 90.909 grand cycles (approximately 27182 years).
        As such, no additional adjustment is made.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because it'd otherwise be difficult to determine which years are leap years, etc., the date is generally written
        in the form "G:C:Y MMM DD", where G is the grand-cycle (period of 23 cycles), C is the cycle (period of 13
        years), Y is the year in the cycle, MMM is the name of the month, and DD is the day of the month. Another
        option, which is usually reserved for computer file systems due to its lexicographic ordering, is "YYYY.JJJ",
        where "YYYY" is the absolute year number, and "JJJ" is the day number of the year.
    </p>

    <p>The first day of the first year would be "1:1:1 Sirelle 1" or 0001.001, and the 43rd day of the 677th year would
        be "3:7:1 Tiri 9" or 0677.043.</p>
