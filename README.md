# Chapter 1 & 2
## The Past Chases the Present

Amara Minori, our narrator and protagonist, wakes up from a nightmare early in the morning. Staring in the mirror, she activates her Maiden transformation before collapsing in grief and anguish. A few hours later, she heads to school, where she's distracted and even more distant than usual. The boy sitting next to her in class, Goya Hideyo, takes note and joins her on the roof for lunch, where she eventually reveals that one year ago, to the day, her best friend, Sono Ikuri, died. Trying to help her put a positive spin on the day, he invites her to the picnic he and his sister, Suzuko, were planning to have after school.

By the time school ends, she has decided to go with them, meeting Suzuko in her classroom for the first time. Because Minori is such an enigma, having transferred to their school and having never spoken about her past, Suzuko decides to ask about it and, to their surprise, she decides to answer, revealing that Ikuri was killed in a terrorist attack one year ago only minutes after she and Minori had parted ways.

Suddenly, she gets a phone call from Itou Haru, her former handler when she worked as in magical combat assist for the JSDF. Itou informs her of a planned terrorist attack at the train station near her in less than one hour, insisting that she is the only one who can possibly stop it from happening. As her emotions (and magical power) flow through her, some of that power flows through her necklace that Suzuko is holding. To both girls' surprise, Suzuko can sense this power, even though she can't identify it.

But without time to explain, Minori rushes off to the train station, activating her powers (but not her transformation) on the way. There, Itou [codename: Indigo Wyvern] tells her how his official orders are to ignore the threat, but it's something that neither he nor Minori [codename: Silver Arrow] are willing to ignore. Eventually, she finds the suspect with a backpack full of explosives, temporarily disables them, and detains the suspect until Itou arrives to take him away. He tries to make conversation with her, but it's also clear that he wants her to rejoin the JSDF, which is not something she's currently willing to entertain, and the conversation turns quiet and awkward.

After Itou has left, Minori deactivates her transformation and retreats to the train station, deciding on a whim to take a train back to Fujiwara, where she lived before transferring to Kamakura. There, she wanders the streets before finding herself in front of a flower shop, deciding to buy a bouquet of flowers to take to Ikuri's grave. To her surprise, Ikuri's younger sister, Kaida, is also there, and she invites Minori over for dinner. After Minori has a short conversation with a copy of Ikuri in her head, she goes with Kaida, and the two reconnect after their long separation, eventually promising to maintain closer contact going forward. In particular, Kaida reveals that she's joined her middle school's Choir Club and invites Minori to the competition occurring in the upcoming weeks.

# Chapter 3
## A New Confidante

The next morning, Minori, back in Kamakura, goes to Suzuko's classroom looking for her. When she kouhai shows up, Minori asks her to join her on the roof for lunch that day, intending both to determine Suzuko's Maidenship and to (embarrassedly) express Minori's interest in spending more time together.

In her own classroom, she apologizes to Hideyo for running off the day before, giving a technically-true-but-misleading explanation for her departure.
