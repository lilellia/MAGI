Though heartbroken by her older sister’s death a year before the story’s start, Rena’s positive, optimistic outlook actually strengthened in the aftermath, leaving her as someone who has learned to appreciate the small things of life. She’s extroverted and social, preferring to wear her heart on her sleeve rather than retreat inward.

As a member of her school’s choir club, her beautiful, clear voice could make her a candidate for the group’s center with practice. However, she’s very self-conscious and embarrassed about her singing, so she much prefers to stay out of the spotlight.
