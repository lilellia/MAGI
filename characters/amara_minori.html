    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <p>
        Calm and collected, Minori tends to keep to herself, though she is personable (if aloof) around others. Her
        aloofness is, however, a coping mechanism: she fears connecting deeply with people around her because she has
        experienced the tragic and painful loss of a friend in the past. As she sees it, she can't be hurt again in the
        same way if she never forms meaningful friendships.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her motivation is revenge against an unfair world and protecting others from the pains it inflicts. She lost her
        childhood best friend, <a href="./calleni_nia.html">Calleni Nia</a>, one year before the story begins to a
        terrorist attack. Jaded and seeing herself responsible for not protecting her, she nonetheless is not afraid to
        get her hands dirty when the situation calls for it, and she's willing to take on a huge weight to save others
        from having to bear the load. If she can protect someone from experiencing the same pain that she has suffered,
        then she will go to great lengths to do so.
    </p>

    <!-- APPEARANCE -->
    <h2>Appearance</h2>

    <p>
        When not wearing the Irèle High School uniform, she is most often seen in unassuming casual clothes, often a
        simple t-shirt and jeans, though she always wears her keystone necklace, no matter the situation. She keeps her
        waist-long silver hair in a ponytail.
    </p>

    <h3>Gown</h3>
    <p>
        Her magical Gown is a skin-tight and flexible silver armor that covers her entire body from her neck down.
        Around her waist is a black belt with red accents, matching those on her armor; a sheath for her katana,
        Requiem, sits on her left hip. In this form, her ponytail is always braided.
    </p>

    <!-- RELATIONS -->
    <h2>Relationships</h2>

    <h3>
        Family
    </h3>
    <p>
        Minori's parents, Amara Lane (father) and Fura Lianne (mother), divorced a few years after Minori was born.
        Their separation was not particularly amicable, though the details were never shared with Minori, who continued
        to live with her father. The two were never especially close, though Lane, an architect, provided Minori with a
        secure childhood. He was opposed to Minori's decision to move to Irèle, but respected this decision nonetheless,
        continuing to cover the majority of her living expenses until she graduates high school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the divorce, Lianne moved to Farès, where she met Theren Pett, whom she later married. The two moved
        to the nation of Turréli some time later. Minori has never met her stepfather and has only the vaguest of
        memories of her mother.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Friends
    </h3>
    <p>
        Young Minori had a few friends in elementary and middle school, chief among them Calleni Nia and her younger
        sister, <a href="./calleni_rena.html">Rena</a>. The two were practically inseparable, and Minori spent nearly as
        much time at Nia's apartment as
        her own. Nia, Rena, and their parents are the only ones (besides Minori's father) who knew of her Maiden powers.
    </p>
    <p>
        After Nia's death in the <a href="../events/siel-shopping-center-incident.md">Siel Shopping Mall terrorist
            attack</a> during their first year of high school, Minori found herself "depressed, lost, and uncertain" and
        moved to Irèle to get away from the trauma. There, she became extremely withdrawn, earning merely a distant
        respect from her classmates and teachers. Only <a href="./molva_atris.html">Molva Atris</a> continued to invest
        much energy in his connection with her, finally introducing her to his sister, <a
            href="./molva_iselle.html">Iselle</a>, on the anniversary of Nia's death.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iselle forms the center of Minori's new social presence, taking the position as her new best friend. Generally
        resembling Nia and Rena in personality, she makes it easy for Minori to recover her previous friendliness and
        amicability, especially given Iselle's own strongly extroverted nature and eagerness to make those around her
        happy. As a fellow Maiden, she also provides a outlet for Minori to express that side of
        herself as well, though Minori also struggles with a protective complex for the younger student, especially in
        the time immediately following Iselle's unsealing.

            tenure as a Magical Combat Assist member. They always maintained a mostly professional relationship, though
            their collaboration has led to a deep care, trust, and comfort around each other. This trust is what causes
            Ari to call upon the retired Minori for the Irèle train station operation and the ensuing investigation into
            the agency conspiracy.

            but difficult to work with on account of her low self-confidence.

    <p>
        As a Maiden, her quick reflexes and decision-making allow her to specialize in rapid-fire attacks that are meant
        to overwhelm the enemy without providing them an opening to take advantage of. Her signature skill is
        Dischronos, a time-dilation spell that enables her to change the pace of time around her, giving her even more
        perceived speed. She likes to attack from multiple angles with well-placed ranged spells to fence in her
        opponents before rushing in while they are flustered and overwhelmed. As such, she struggles against targets who
        don't fear her and those who remain composed during the fight, as well as against large groups of enemies.

            Origin of spell names:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Alsýon</i> — From the English word <i>halcyon</i> &lt; ME <i>alceon</i> &lt; L <i>halcyon</i>
                    &lt; Gk <i>aklyōn</i>: calm, peaceful.

                    <blockquote>
                        According to Greek mythology, Alkyone, the daughter of the god of the winds, became so
                        distraught when she learned that her husband had been killed in a shipwreck that she threw
                        herself into the sea and was changed into a kingfisher. As a result, ancient Greeks called such
                        birds alkyon or halkyon. The legend also says that such birds built floating nests on the sea,
                        where they so charmed the wind god that he created a period of unusual calm that lasted until
                        the birds' eggs hatched. This legend prompted people to use halcyon both as a noun naming a
                        genus of kingfisher and as an adjective meaning either "of or relating to the kingfisher or its
                        nesting period" or calm.<a class="ref" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/halcyon"
