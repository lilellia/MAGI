As a Maiden, her quick reflexes and decision-making allow her to specialize in rapid-fire attacks that are meant to overwhelm the enemy without providing them an opening to take advantage of. Her ultimate skill is *Dischronos*, a time-dilation spell that enables her to change the pace of time around her, giving her even more perceived speed. She likes to attack from multiple angles with well-placed ranged spells to fence in her opponents before rushing in while they are flustered and overwhelmed. As such, she struggles against targets who don’t fear her and those who remain composed during the fight, as well as against large groups of enemies.

## Trivia

- Her name comes from the Japanese names <ruby><rb>天</rb><rt>あま</rt><rb>良</rb><rt>ら</rt></ruby> (*ama*: sky, heaven + *ra*: good, virtuous) and <ruby><rb>穣</rb><rt>みのり</rt></ruby> (*minori*: abundant; often written in hiragana).
- Origin of spell names:
  - *Khione* (also spelled "Chione", from Greek <ruby><rb>χιών</rb><rt>*chión*</rt></ruby> "snow") was a Greek goddess of the north wind, which brought the winter coldness.
  - *Alsýon*: From the English *halcyon* < ME *alceon* < L *halcyon* < Gk *alkyōn*: calm, peaceful.
    > According to Greek mythology, Alkyone, the daughter of the god of the winds, became so distraught when she learned that her husband had been killed in a shipwreck that she threw herself into the sea and was changed into a kingfisher. As a result, ancient Greeks called such birds *alkyon* or *halkyon*. The legend also says that such birds built floating nests on the sea, where they so charmed the wind god that he created a period of unusual calm that lasted until the birds' eggs hatched. This legend prompted people to use *halcyon* both as a noun naming a genus of kingfisher and as an adjective meaning either "of or relating to the kingfisher or its nesting period" or calm.

  - *Dischronos* is a combination of *dis* (Latin "apart, asunder") and *chronos* (Greek "time")
