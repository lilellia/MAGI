Kotori is a really sweet girl. She’s outgoing, caring, and athletic (being a member of her school’s volleyball team). She’s competent at just about anything without trying; her problem is that, as soon as she needs to do something (putting in conscious effort), she suddenly and utterly (often spectacularly) fails. This gives her a very carefree mindset, preferring to attack any and all problems head-on without any planning.
