Kozue is blunt. A confident girl, she is direct in both her speech and her actions. Because she believes that nothing can stop her, she can come off as arrogant, though this is not her intention. She genuïnely believes that absolutely any problem can be solved if you’re willing to put in enough effort. Difficult? Sure. But not impossible.

She’s willing to help others, but prefers to enable their betterment. She’s a firm believer in the idea that “if you give a man a fish, he’ll be fed for a day; teach him to fish, and he’ll be fed for the rest of his life.” Outside of school, she spends much of her time practicing or training for whatever obstacle is the current focus of her attention.

In battle, she prefers to utilize her natural bulk and strength to her advantage, tanking hits and responding with devastating blows from her huge two-handed sword. Since speed and mobility are not her primary concern, her battle dress features heavy metallic armor to aid in her defensive abilities. Her signature, [[Barrier]], allows her to boost even further, erecting a sphere of influence around herself that dissipates a high fraction of magical attacks. She struggles against foes with high mobility or hit-and-run tactics since she’s generally unable to punish their attacks, though even they need to be wary about taking a stray hit from her.

| Spell Name | Element | Mana Consumption | Effect |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [[Barrier]] | {Lightning} | high | In a sphere of influence around her, deflect or otherwise dissipate up to 75% of magical attacks.
