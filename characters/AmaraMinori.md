Calm and collected, Minori tends to keep to herself, though she is personable (if aloof) around others. Her aloofness is, however, a coping mechanism: she fears connecting deeply with people around her because she has experienced the tragic and painful loss of a friend in the past. As she sees it, she can’t be hurt again in the same way if she never forms meaningful friendships.

Her motivation is revenge against an unfair world and protecting others from the pains it inflicts. She lost her childhood best friend, Sono Ikuri, one year before the story begins to a terrorist attack. Jaded and seeing herself responsible for not protecting her, she nonetheless is not afraid to get her hands dirty when the situation calls for it, and she’s willing to take on a huge weight to save others from having to bear the load. If she can protect someone from experiencing the same pain that she has suffered, then she will go to great lengths to do so.

When not wearing the Kamakura High School uniform, she is most often seen in unassuming casual clothes, often a simple t-shirt and jeans, though she always wears her keystone necklace, no matter the situation. She keeps her waist-long silver hair in a ponytail.

Her battle dress is a skin-tight and flexible silver armor that covers her entire body from her neck down. Around her waist is a black belt with red accents; a sheath for her katana, «Requiem», sits on her left hip. In this form, her ponytail is always braided.

As a Maiden, her quick reflexes and decision-making allow her to specialize in rapid-fire attacks that are meant to overwhelm the enemy without providing them an opening to take advantage of. Her signature skill is [[Dischronos]], a time-dilation spell that enables her to change the pace of time around her, giving her even more perceived speed. She likes to attack from multiple angles with well-placed ranged spells to fence in her opponents before rushing in while they are flustered and overwhelmed. As such, she struggles against targets who don’t fear her and those who remain composed during the fight, as well as against large groups of enemies.

### Trivia

  - *Khione* (also spelled "Chione", from Greek χιών "snow") was a Greek goddess of the north wind, which brought the winter coldness.
  - *Dischronos* is a combination of *dis* (Latin "apart, asunder") and *chronos* (Greek "time")
