One of Amara Minori's classmates, he is the middle brother between [Iselle](./Molva%20Iselle.md) (younger) and [Natalia](./Molva%20Natalia.md) (older). His seriousness is the target of teasing by his carefree younger sister, with whom he's very close, but he doesn't take much offense to it. He is genuinely caring and is constantly looking out for both Iselle as a protective older brother and Minori as her first friend in her new school.

## Trivia

- His last name comes from the Russian word <ruby><rb>королева</rb><rt>*koroleva*</rt></ruby>, meaning "queen" and is, accordingly, more befitting his sisters.
- His first name, *Atris*, is a loose reference to the name *Tristan* from the legend *Tristan and Iseult*. The name *Tristan* derives from any of Welsh *trist*, French *triste*, and Latin *tristis*, all meaning "sad" or "sorrowful"; Atris's name begins with the Greek negation particle *a-* to counteract this. Though their relationship is in no way romantic, this reference reflects the closeness between Atris and his younger sister, Iselle (whose name resembles *Iseult*).
