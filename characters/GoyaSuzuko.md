Suzuko is a bundle of energy.

Amara Minori quickly learns that Suzuko has untapped magical abilities and soon tells the kouhai. Eventually, when Suzuko’s older sister, Miyu, dies of illness, Minori takes Suzuko on as an apprentice (partly to shut her up). The latter is thrilled, devoting nearly all of her efforts to her training, rising in skill remarkably quickly. Minori later invites her to join MAGI. When she accepts, Minori forces Suzuko to drop the -senpai and -sensei honorifics as they are now equal partners.

She has always had a close relationship with her brother, Hideyo, growing up, and they are both eager to reconnect after the year they were apart going to different schools; by contrast, her older sister has always distanced herself from the two, especially given the large age gap between them, yet Suzuko admires and respects Miyu’s dedication despite Miyu being unpopular.

Suzuko is motivated by honor, loyalty, and friendship, devoting herself to Minori’s cause of protection, fueled by Miyu’s death. Her goal is to bring happiness to as many people as she possibly can.
