Having graduated from a prestigious college and attained a position as an assistant to a high-ranking board member at a F500 company, she has a sophistication and maturity that her siblings and their peers don’t. However, this experience, intelligence, and success have left her dismissive and condescending, both underestimating her accomplishments (immediately forgetting or belittling the efforts she put in and thinking they ought to be easy to match) and criticizing those who can’t or haven’t yet matched her. She is often seen as a bit of a stuck-up bitch, though few dare say that to her face. Combined with the large age gap between them, she’s never been close with her younger siblings, though they each look up to and respect her in their own ways, often citing that she wasn't quite as bad when she was younger.

## Trivia

- Her last name comes from the Russian word <ruby><rb>королева</rb><rt>*koroleva*</rt></ruby>, meaning "queen". Though the name is a chained reference for Iselle, it can also be seen to apply to Natalia in reference to her general success, status, and condescending nature.
