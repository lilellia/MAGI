Yumi is a mature, fairly no-nonsense kind of girl. Generally level-headed, she nonetheless can be impatient and distant, failing to understand the emotional complexity of a situation. She’s a quick, decisive thinker and isn’t afraid to speak her mind about an issue, unconcerned about offending people. If you need an honest, to-the-point perspective, Yumi’s a good person to ask, though be prepared for her somewhat abrasive remarks. Despite this, she’s a natural leader, and her skills make up for her rough personality, and she’s generally well-liked and respected. When her followers manage to annoy her, she has been known to simply dismiss them and take on the problem herself.
