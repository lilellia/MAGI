# Amara Minori

## Overview

- **Name:** Amara Minori
- **Nickname(s):**
  - Snow Leopard (CIA codename)
  - Mino-chi (by Calleni Rena and, later, Molva Iselle)
- **Race:** Human (Maiden)
- **Gender:** Female
- **Birthday:** 7:16:9 Tiri 06 (aged 16)
- **Affiliations:**
  - Current:
    - Team MAGI (founder, *de facto* leader)

  - Former:
    - Clerèssian Intelligence Agency, Magical Combat Assist Unit (member)
    - Siel High School

&nbsp;

Calm and collected, Minori tends to keep to herself, though she is personable (if aloof) around others. Her aloofness is, however, a coping mechanism: she fears connecting deeply with people around her because she has experienced the tragic and painful loss of a friend in the past. As she sees it, she can’t be hurt again in the same way if she never forms meaningful friendships.

Her motivation is revenge against an unfair world and protecting others from the pains it inflicts. She lost her childhood best friend, Calleni Nia, one year before the story begins to a terrorist attack. Jaded and seeing herself responsible for not protecting her, she nonetheless is not afraid to get her hands dirty when the situation calls for it, and she’s willing to take on a huge weight to save others from having to bear the load. If she can protect someone from experiencing the same pain that she has suffered, then she will go to great lengths to do so.

When not wearing the Irèle High School uniform, she is most often seen in unassuming casual clothes, often a simple t-shirt and jeans, though she always wears her keystone necklace, no matter the situation. She keeps her waist-long silver hair in a ponytail.

Her magical Gown is a skin-tight and flexible silver armor that covers her entire body from her neck down. Around her waist is a black belt with red accents, matching those on her armor; a sheath for her katana, *Requiem*, sits on her left hip. In this form, her ponytail is always braided.

&nbsp;

As a Maiden, her quick reflexes and decision-making allow her to specialize in rapid-fire attacks that are meant to overwhelm the enemy without providing them an opening to take advantage of. Her signature skill is *Dischronos*, a time-dilation spell that enables her to change the pace of time around her, giving her even more perceived speed. She likes to attack from multiple angles with well-placed ranged spells to fence in her opponents before rushing in while they are flustered and overwhelmed. As such, she struggles against targets who don’t fear her and those who remain composed during the fight, as well as against large groups of enemies.

### Known Spells

- *Alsýon*

- *Dischronos*

## Relationships

### Family

Minori's parents, Amara Lane (father) and Fura Lianne (mother), divorced a few years after Minori was born. Their separation was not particularly amicable, though the details were never shared with Minori, who continued to live with her father. The two were never especially close, though Lane, an architect, provided Minori with a secure childhood. He was opposed to Minori's decision to move to Irèle, but respected this decision nonetheless, continuing to cover the majority of her living expenses until she graduates high school.

Following the divorce, Lianne moved to Farès, where she met Theren Pett, whom she later married. The two moved to the nation of Turréli some time later. Minori has never met her stepfather and has only the vaguest of memories of her mother.

### Friends

Young Minori had a few friends in elementary and middle school, chief among them Calleni Nia and her younger sister, Rena. The two were practically inseparable, and Minori spent nearly as much time at Nia's apartment as her own. Nia, Rena, and their parents are the only ones (besides Minori's father) who knew of her Maiden powers.

After Nia's death in the Siel Shopping Mall terrorist attack during their first year of high school, Minori found herself "depressed, lost, and uncertain" and moved to Irèle to get away from the trauma. There, she became extremely withdrawn, earning merely a distant respect from her classmates and teachers. Only Molva Atris continued to invest much energy in their connection with her, finally introducing her to his sister, Iselle, on the anniversary of Nia's death. 

Iselle forms the center of Minori's new social presence, taking the position as her new best friend. Generally resembling Nia and Rena in personality, she makes it easy for Minori to recover her previous friendliness and amicability, especially given Iselle's own strongly extroverted nature and eagerness to make those around her happy. As a fellow Maiden (unsealed by Minori), she also provides a outlet for Minori to express that side of herself as well, though Minori also struggles with a protective complex for the younger student, especially in the time immediately following Iselle's unsealing.


### Clerèssian Intelligence Agency

- Kaskei Ari — Ari (*Indigo Wyvern*) was Minori's handler during her tenure as a Magical Combat Assist member, stationed in Siel. They always maintained a mostly professional relationship, though their collaboration has led to a deep care, trust, and comfort around each other. For example, we see Minori teasing him during the Irèle train station operation in a way that stands in contrast to the way she acts even around the Molva siblings earlier that day:

  > "But," and I can hear his smile through the phone, "as you've so sharply pointed out, you don't work for us anymore, so you're perfect."
  > 
  > Despite myself, I find myself smiling as well. "Or am I just the only girl who hasn't blocked your number yet?"

  This trust is what causes Ari to call upon the retired Minori for the aforementioned operation and the ensuing investigation into the agency conspiracy.
- Miú Aya — Aya (*Crimson Wolf*) is another Maiden employed by the Magical Combat Assist unit, stationed in Siana. She is the one who unsealed Minori's powers four years ago, and while they're by no means close, they remain on good terms, having worked together a few times in the years since.
- Koyo Gwynne — Gwynne (*Black Swan*) is another Maiden employed by the Magical Combat Assist unit, normally stationed in Kýo. She and Minori have worked together once and share no particular relationship beyond this colleague-aquaintance nature. Minori describes her as capable but difficult to work with.

## Trivia

- Her name comes from the Japanese names <ruby><rb>天</rb><rt>あま</rt><rb>良</rb><rt>ら</rt></ruby> (*ama*: sky, heaven + *ra*: good, virtuous) and <ruby><rb>穣</rb><rt>みのり</rt></ruby> (*minori*: abundant; often written in hiragana).
- Origin of spell names:
  - *Khione* (also spelled "Chione", from Greek <ruby><rb>χιών</rb><rt>*chión*</rt></ruby> "snow") was a Greek goddess of the north wind, which brought the winter coldness.
  - *Alsýon*: From the English *halcyon* < ME *alceon* < L *halcyon* < Gk *alkyōn*: calm, peaceful.
    > According to Greek mythology, Alkyone, the daughter of the god of the winds, became so distraught when she learned that her husband had been killed in a shipwreck that she threw herself into the sea and was changed into a kingfisher. As a result, ancient Greeks called such birds *alkyon* or *halkyon*. The legend also says that such birds built floating nests on the sea, where they so charmed the wind god that he created a period of unusual calm that lasted until the birds' eggs hatched. This legend prompted people to use *halcyon* both as a noun naming a genus of kingfisher and as an adjective meaning either "of or relating to the kingfisher or its nesting period" or calm.

  - *Dischronos* is a combination of *dis* (Latin "apart, asunder") and *chronos* (Greek "time")
