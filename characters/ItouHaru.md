Haru doesn’t mess around. He’s kind, but he just wants to get to work. Smart and careful, he’s a great commander, and he has the experience to back it up, being a former member of the JSDF army and Amara Minori’s former handler. This means that he’s quite capable in non-magical combat, and his ability to command makes him valuable in magical combat as well, just from a bit further away.

In personal settings, he gets much more flustered (which Minori often takes advantage of, much to his chagrin), since these are situations that cannot be resolved with a hard attitude. As such, though he’s clever and observant, he’s also socially awkward, unable to relax, and isn’t likely to win an argument.
