    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <p>
        Though heartbroken by her <a href="./calleni_nia.html">older sister</a>'s death a year before the story's start,
        Rena's positive, optimistic
        outlook actually strengthened in the aftermath, leaving her as someone who has learned to appreciate the small
        things of life. She's extroverted and social, preferring to wear her heart on her sleeve rather than retreat
        inward.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a member of her school's choir club, her beautiful, clear voice could make her a candidate for the group's
        center with practice. However, she's very self-conscious and embarrassed about her singing, so she much prefers
        to stay out of the spotlight.
    </p>

    <!-- APPEARANCE -->
    <h2>Appearance</h2>

    <p>
        Physically, Rena looks like a typical cute middle school girl. She wears her light brown hair in a pair of
        twintails down to her armpits, securing them with black hair ties, and her golden eyes stand out against her
        pale complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her middle school uniform features a white collared shirt underneath a maroon jacket and striped tie with a a
        mid-thigh-length black pleated skirt.
