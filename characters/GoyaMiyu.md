Having graduated from college, she has a sophistication and maturity that her siblings and their peers don’t. However, this experience, intelligence, and success have left her dismissive and condescending, both underestimating her accomplishments (believing that they ought to be easy, even trivial to match) and criticizing those who can’t or haven’t done so (in a “I can’t believe you haven’t even done X, Y, or Z yet!” kind of way). She is generally seen as a bit of a stuck-up bitch, though few dare say that to her face. Combined with the age gap between them, she’s never been close with her siblings, though they each look up to and respect her in their own ways, often citing that she was different growing up.
