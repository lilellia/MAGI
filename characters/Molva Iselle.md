&nbsp;

Iselle is a bundle of energy. She has always had a very close relationship with her brother growing up, and they are both eager to reconnect after the year they were apart going to schools in different cities; by contrast, her older sister has always distanced herself from the two, especially given the large age gap between them. Despite this, Iselle admires and respects her sister’s dedication despite her relative unpopularity.

When Amara Minori learns that Iselle has untapped and previously-unknown magical abilities, she quickly tells her in order to prevent the younger girl from the confusion and fear that she’d experienced in unlocking her own powers. Despite this, Minori is determined that Iselle won’t fight for the CIA and thus refuses to unlock her powers until Iselle’s older sister dies at the enemy’s hand. At this point, Iselle becomes Minori’s apprentice and is absolutely thrilled, dedicating nearly all efforts to her training, rising in skill remarkably quickly. The two become founding members of Team MAGI.

She is motivated by honor, loyalty, and friendship, and she is drawn to Minori’s duty to protect those less powerful than herself. Her goal is to bring happiness to as many people as she possibly can.

When not wearing the Irèle High School uniform, she prefers to wear cute or otherwise fashionable outfits, and she puts a noticeable effort into her appearance.

Her magical Gown consists of a translucent teal-blue dress atop a strapless bandeau bra and shorts. The dress's skirt reaches to her mid-thigh, colored with streaks of lighter blues and whites that give the garment a sense of depth and motion; the underworn shorts come a few centimeters short of the skirt's hem. During her full transformation, her hair shimmers, turning from its normal blue-green to a bright, pale blue, though she can repress this effect as well.

&nbsp;

As a Maiden, she specializes in support (ally buff/enemy debuff) and healing, preferring to attack from a distance. She struggles in close-range/melee combat, though she can use her staff as a makeshift shield against some attacks, and she carries a small dagger in the left boot of her Gown. Though she specializes in support, she also possesses relatively strong offensive magic as well, though it exhausts her comparatively quickly.

### Known Spells

- *Echoes*
  
  boost the magical strength and rate of mana regeneration for herself or a nearby ally

## Relationships

### Family

Iselle has two older siblings: Natalia (sister) and Atris (brother). Natalia was eleven when Iselle was born, and this age gap was difficult for the sisters to overcome, which wasn't aided by Natalia's general lack of interest in fostering relationships with her family. In fact, Natalia's success at nearly everything she touched made it impossible for Iselle to follow in her footsteps, an expectation unfairly leveled at her by her parents and other family members (apart from Atris, who was generally exempted from these comparisons on account of being a boy). In Atris's words:

> [Iselle's] fourteen, but since Natalia-ren's so much older, our parents tend to forget that she's not, like, six by comparison. As the two girls, they get compared a lot, something I was lucky enough to avoid most of the time. Natalia-ren set the bar so impossibly high in so many ways, and being held to those same standards, even as an anchor, has been really hard on Isa. Especially when she gave up trying to follow in her footsteps and just become her own person. [...T]here's always been a tension between her and Natalia-ren, though Isa usually tries to downplay it. She won't admit it, but now that she has the option not to be home for Natalia-ren's birthday—a celebration of the unchosen rival she could never hope to beat—she's definitely excited to take it. (Chapter V).

By contrast, Iselle describes her and Atris as "inseparable"; Atris calls them "undeniably close" and calls Iselle his "best friend". This likely stems from Atris's favorable treatment of her growing up in a home that wasn't always as welcoming as she might have preferred.

No specific information is known about her parents or other family beyond what can be inferred via her relationship with Natalia.

### Friends

- Amara Minori — Minori and Atris would have to fight over the title of Iselle's best friend. At first, Iselle sees Minori as the mysterious and infamously aloof upperclassman, and she's eager to befriend her.

## Trivia

- Her last name comes from the Russian word <ruby><rb>королева</rb><rt>*koroleva*</rt></ruby>, meaning "queen". She controls water magic, so there is a loose association chain between water → rain → reign (homophone) → queen. Her given name, Iselle, is of unknown origin [(source)](https://nameberry.com/babyname/Iselle) but could be related to names such as Isabelle.
  - Her given name resembles that of Isolde Ennets, deuteragonist of *Elena*, another of Lily Ellington's books. In particular, they are both deuteragonists who share the nickname *Isa*. That Iselle's last name is a corruption of "queen" is also a reference to Isolde being a princess of her home nation of Incerin.
- Character appearance references:
  - Her general appearance is inspired by [this recolored image](./references/molva-iselle-01.png) of Etou Kanami from the anime *Toji no Miko* — [(original image)](https://rei.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/42795-1277625042.jpg).
  - Her Gown is inspired by [this dress](./references/molva-iselle-02.jpg), sold [here](https://flashyouandme.com/product/deep-water-mesh-babydoll-dress-with-deep-decollette/). Obviously, that's a lot more translucent than Iselle could wear on its own (which bespeaks its existence as lingerie), so she has a white bandeau bra and a pair of white spandex shorts that come a few centimeters short of the hem of the skirt, which itself reaches just past her mid-thigh (a bit longer than the reference image's). In addition, the skirt is "streaked withh lighter blues and whites", similar to the train of Elsa's ice dress in *Frozen*, though done as streaks of color rather than snowflake patterns.
  - The way that her hair shimmers in her transformation is reminiscent of [Chikama Yashiro's](references/molva-iselle-03.png) in the anime *Adachi to Shimamura*, though not as vibrant.
