- Iselle's choice of -ryo (raised honorific) for her older sister should stand out given that she uses -chi (intimate) with her brother. This sets Minori up for an observation in chapter 5.
    > "We're from further away than you are," Iselle explains. "Hollen, up in the midlands. But that's sort of what my brother said when he'd come to visit over breaks last year." She pauses, then quickly clarifies. "That part about it being home and yet… not, somehow?" She sighs, turning her gaze out the window. "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">We have an older sister, Natalia-ryo.</span> Graduated university and is now up in Farès, working as a personal assistant to some big-name executive. We were never that close growing up. She was in middle school before I could even talk that well, and she can be a bit self-absorbed, but I vaguely remember her feeling the same way, too."

- Iselle is careful to say it quietly enough for Minori not to hear, but her response is "Well, neither are you [all rainbows and sunshine]."
    > It takes me a second to grasp her implication. "You don't want to be involved," I tell her. "It's not all rainbows and sunshine. Besides, you're not trained to know what to look for."
    > 
    > <span style="text-decoration: underline;">She mumbles a response that I can't quite make out.</span> Though it doesn't sound like one of agreement, she doesn't force the issue any further, letting her silence speak for itself.

## V: A New Era

- What Minori is actually reacting to is how Atris used -ren (neutral honorific) to refer to Natalia, compared to Iselle's use of -ryo (raised) in the previous chapter. Given their personalities (and the fact that he uses Iselle's bare name instead of, e.g., Iselle-chi or Isa-chi), we'd expect Iselle to be the one using lower honorifics here. This difference helps to illustrate the tension between the two sisters that Atris explains to Minori later in this scene.
    > Atris continues staring between us, trying to understand the stalemate that the discussion has become before shrugging. "Either way, I'd better finish packing everything and get going. It wouldn't do for me to be late for Natalia-ren's birthday." When I cock my head at him slightly, he continues. "It's the day after tomorrow. She's turning twenty-six this year."
    > 
    > <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That's not the only part of his comment I was reacting to, but I let it go.</span> When I can't find anything to say to follow up, Iselle starts to take the reins of the conversation. "Make sure to wish her a happy birthday for me, will you, A-chi?" He nods, then she turns back to me. "Minori-ryo, will you come with me?"


## VI: Language of the Fae

- There might be a better transcription, but the "Nn" is meant here as a sound of disagreement, reminiscient of the Japanese <ruby><rb>ううん</rb><rt style="font-size: 75%;">*uun*</rt></ruby>, as [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.crunchyroll.com/puella-magi-madoka-magica/episode-12-my-very-best-friend-591757):

    > Fortunately, I'm braced for the blast of power that erupts from her as her seal is broken. A shiver passes over me as the magic emanates throughout the room. I wonder if she can also feel the comparatively calm, gentle energy flowing from where my hand meets hers on the glass. "*Charistí, Neyu*," I whisper in thanks.
    > 
    > *<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nn.</span> Thank you, Minori*, I hear the response in my head, in affected Clerèssian.
