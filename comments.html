    <h2>I: The Past Chases the Present</h2>

    <h2>II: Same, Yet Different</h2>

    <h2>III: A New Confidante</h2>

    <h2>IV: In Concert</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Iselle's choice of "-ryo" (raised honorific) to refer to her older sister should stand out here given that
            she uses "-chi" (intimate) with her brother. This sets Minori up for an observation in chapter V.

            <blockquote>
                "We're from further away than you are," Iselle explains. "Hollen, up in the midlands. But that's sort of
                what my brother said when he'd come to visit over breaks last year." She pauses, then quickly clarifies.
                "That part about it being home and yet… not, somehow?" She sighs, turning her gaze out the window.
                "<span class="ul">We have an older sister, Natalia-ryo.</span> Graduated university and is now up in
                Farès, working as a personal assistant to some big-name executive. We were never that close growing up.
                She was in middle school before I could even talk that well, and she can be a bit self-absorbed, but I
                vaguely remember her feeling the same way, too."
            </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
            Iselle is careful to say it quietly enough for Minori not to hear, but her response is "Well, neither are
            you [all rainbows and sunshine]."

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    It takes me a second to grasp her implication. "You don't want to be involved," I tell her. "It's
                    not all rainbows and sunshine. Besides, you're not trained to know what to look for."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="ul">She mumbles a response that I can't quite make out.</span> Though it doesn't sound
                    like one of agreement, she doesn't force the issue any further, letting her silence speak for
                    itself.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>V: A New Era</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            What Minori is actually reacting to is how Atris used -ren (neutral honorific) to refer to Natalia, compared
            to Iselle's use of -ryo (raised) in the previous chapter. Given their personalities (and the fact that he
            uses Iselle's bare name instead of, e.g., Iselle-chi or Isa-chi), we'd expect Iselle to be the one using
            lower honorifics here. This difference helps to illustrate the tension between the two sisters that Atris
            explains to Minori later in this scene.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Atris continues staring between us, trying to understand the stalemate that the discussion has
                    become before shrugging. "Either way, I'd better finish packing everything and get going. It
                    wouldn't do for me to be late for Natalia-ren's birthday." When I cock my head at him slightly, he
                    continues. "It's the day after tomorrow. She's turning twenty-six this year."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="ul">That's not the only part of his comment I was reacting to, but I let it go.</span>
                    When I can't find anything to say to follow up, Iselle starts to take the reins of the conversation.
                    "Make sure to wish her a happy birthday for me, will you, A-chi?" He nods, then she turns back to
                    me. "Minori-ryo, will you come with me?"
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>VI: Language of the Fae</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In the unsealing spell, Minori makes reference to the Maidens as "daughters of the Fae" and as "sisters" (of
            each other). While there is a connection between the Maidens and the Fae, it's not familial. These terms,
            here, are purely terms of societal kinship or fellowship; compare to <i>sisters of a convent</i>.

            <blockquote>
                "I call out to you," I say in the Faen language, imbuing the language with my magic, "<span
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">fellow daughter of the Fae</span>. I promise to be your
                protector, just as we, together, are the protectors of the world. Release this seal and accept your
                destiny!" I soften my gaze, taking her other hand in mine with a smile. "We welcome you, <span
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">sister Iselle</span>."
            </blockquote>
