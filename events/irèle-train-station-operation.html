    <p>
        The Irèle Train Station Operation was an unofficial operation performed by CIA analyst <a
            href="../characters/kaskei_ari.html">Kaskei Ari</a> and retired 1LT/Maiden <a
            href="../characters/amara_minori.html">Amara Minori</a> in the afternoon of <span class="tooltip">7:17:12
            Enna 28<span>2014.096</span></span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        At 15:07, Ari intercepted an encrypted message. Despite passing through unofficial channels, the message was
        encrypted using one of the Clerèssian Intelligence Agency's standard encryption schemes, and decrypted to

        <blockquote>
            SET CHARGE. IRÈLE T STATION. PLAT 3. 1615.
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        Concerned, Ari alerted his superiors, who dismissed him, stating that it was nothing more than a means of
        testing the agents and that having reported it was the extent of Ari's responsibility in the matter. However,
        Ari was unconvinced and couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. When his concerns fell on
        deaf ears, he reached out to Minori at 15:41 to enlist her help since she was in Irèle and could quickly
        respond.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having left the agency a year prior in the wake of her best friend's death in the <a
            href="./siel-shopping-center-incident.html">Siel Shopping Center Incident</a>, Minori was initially
        hesitant to take up the operation. However, Ari was able to convince her, and she arrived at the train
        station eighteen minutes before the target time.
    </p>

    <p>
        After scanning the other platforms, she took position in the center of platform 3, where she was approached
        with four minutes before the target time by a middle-aged man in a gray uniform. He seemed suspicious, and
        when he left his bag under Minori's care before leaving for the restroom, she discovered the expected
        explosives under a few books. She temporarily neutralized the explosives with her magic before confronting the
        man in the restroom.
    </p>

    <p>
        He was able to put up only minimal resistance before Minori led him out to the benches on the exterior of the
        station to wait for Ari to arrive and take her prisoner. In the meantime, she was able to identify him as
        <a class="null" href="../characters/enason_lambing.html">Enason Lambing</a>, a civilian accountant who had
        been threatened into committing the crime by unknown forces a few weeks prior.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ari soon arrived with a bomb technician to permanently diffuse the bombs. In his follow-up interrogation and
        off-the-books investigation, he was not able to determine much of any information regarding the incident.
