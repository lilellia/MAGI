    <p>
        The Siel Shopping Center Incident, also known colloquially as "S.S.C.I." (alternatively pronounced "sky"), was a
        terrorist attack committed at the titular shopping mall during the afternoon of <span class="tooltip">7:17:11
            Enna 28.<span>2013.096</span></span> The attack resulted in forty-one fatalities and an esimated one hundred
        injuries. The damage to the building was repaired within only four months and cost an estimated $870,000,000.
    </p>

    <p>
        At 16:11:34, the first explosion occurred on the lower floor on the eastern side of the building. At least one
        of the explosions was caused by a charge laid into a load-bearing support pillar, causing the localized collapse
        of the upper floor. A secondary explosion occurred only one second later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite investigations, the perpetrators of the attack were never determined, and no official suspects were ever
        named. Many have speculated it an act of <i>stochastic terrorism</i>, whose primary concern is the elicitation
        of fear as a result of its unpredicted and poorly-understood nature.

                    Starting at 1612 hours on <span class="tooltip">Enna 28 of this year<span>2013.096</span></span>,
                    reports were made to local police stations of
                    several large explosions on the interior of the eastern side of the Siel Shopping Mall. A
                    significant amount of damage was rendered to the building, and the loss of several support
                    structures caused the localized collapse of the upper floor onto the lower. A total of forty-one
                    casualties and twenty-three additional injuries was reported.

                <p class="strong">The Investigation</p>
            </li>
            <p>
                The investigation began when 1LT/MAIDEN codenamed
                &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; of the Magical
                Combat Unit, stationed in Siel, responded nearly immediately to the scene. Though not on official duty,
                she had accompanied &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, aged
                &#9608;&#9608; and one of the fatally wounded, to the location just minutes before the incident. She
                would affirm in her report that she had noticed no reason to suspect the impending incident, nor did she
                take notice of any magical Imprint in the area, neither before nor immediately following the explosion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Local police arrived on scene at 1618 hours. According to our investigations, these officers prioritized
                the evacuation and rescue of those persons nearest the epicenter of the explosions, followed swiftly by
                the remainder of the building. They, as well, found no immediate indications as the perpetrator(s) of
                the attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 1709 hours, an agency investigatory team headed by Col
                &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; and consisting otherwise of Sgts
                &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; and
                &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; arrived on site, assisting
                with the investigation being led by local police, including
                &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, who was stationed in the
                mall and who affirmed then and later that there had been no known indications found by either routine
                monitoring of the area, proactive civilian reports, nor by another means. The agency's team affirmed the
                same, adding that there had been no known intercept of communication that would have led to
                investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Security cameras within the mall, as well as those from three adjacent businesses, confirmed that the
                explosions occurred at precisely 16:11:34 and 16:11:35. All cameras within fifteen (15) meters of the
                epicenter were destroyed; three further cameras which were aimed at either of the epicenters were only
                able to indicate that at least one of the charges was set inside one of the building's support pillars.
                Unfortunately, no persons near the epicenters were able to confirm nor deny any additional details
                regarding the placement of the explosives, and none of the survivors attested to observing any
                indications of the imminent explosions, including (but not limited to) any hypothetical warnings made by
                any other persons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sgt &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; led the post-blast explosives analysis. His testing revealed
                that
                the chosen explosive was likely composition C-4 plastic explosive in quantities likely bound between
                eight (8) and twenty (20) kilograms. Despite his efforts, it was not possible to identify the signature
                of the explosives, making directly identifying its source impossible. It is known that C-4 is easy and
                common to detonate remotely, and the investigation found no reason to dispute this hypothesis. However,
                by the time that radio analysis could be confirmed, there was no way to detect, nor identify, the source
                of this hypothetical remote detonation. Cross-referencing cellular phone traffic around the time of the
                explosions found no usable results. It is clear, however, that this explosion could not have been a
                reasonable accident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further efforts made by Col &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;'s team, as well as those of the local
                police, led investigations into each of the gang circles within Siel and the neighboring areas. By Fis
                02, a larger governmental investigation, also led by Col &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, was
                initiated and focused on determining and identifying foreign involvement or interference. None was
                found.
            </p>
            <p>
                When no Terran lead was found, two Fae representatives were contacted in the course of the
                investigation. Their reports, filed Fis 11, affirmed that they had no knowledge of any supernatural
                involvement, the which was supported by the lack of magical Imprint detected by
                &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; at the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                The incident has long been branded a terrorist attack by the civilian media, and we have been able to
                find no other reasonable hypothesis. Though some smaller-scale investigations will continue for the
                foreseeable future, at the time at which this report is written, full-scale investigations have largely
                stalled for having exhausted all currently-known investigative leads without success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of further relevant note is that this incident does not closely resemble any known recorded incident in
                the recent past, nor have any similar incidents been recorded in the month since.
