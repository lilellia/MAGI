# Siel Shopping Center Incident

The Siel Shopping Center Incident was a terrorist attack committed at the titular shopping mall during the afternoon of 7:17:11 Enna 28. The attack resulted in forty-one fatalities and an estimated one hundred injuries. The damage to the building was repaired within just three months and cost an estimated $870 million.

At 16:11:34, the first explosion occurred on the lower floor on the eastern side of the building. At least one of the explosions was caused by a charge laid into a load-bearing support pillar, causing the localized collapse of the upper floor. A secondary explosion occurred only one second later.

Despite investigations, the perpetrators of the attack were never determined, and no official suspects were ever named. Many have speculated it an act of *stochastic terrorism*, whose primary concern is the elicitation of fear as a result of its unpredicted and poorly-understood nature.

As the result of privacy concerns, the names of the victims were never released.
