This is a report summarizing the investigation into the recent attack on the Siel Shopping Center, codename Incident Panda-II.

1. **Summary of the Incident**

    Starting at 1612 hours on Enna 28 of this year, reports were made to local police stations of several large explosions on the interior of the eastern side of the Siel Shopping Mall. A significant amount of damage was rendered to the building, and the loss of several support structures caused the localized collapse of the upper floor onto the lower. A total of forty-one casualties and twenty-three additional injuries was reported.

2. **The Investigation**

    The investigation began when 1 Lt and Maiden codenamed &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; of the Magical Combat Unit, stationed in Siel, responded nearly immediately to the scene. Though not on official duty, she had accompanied &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, aged &#9608;&#9608; and one of the fatally wounded, to the location just minutes before the incident. She would affirm in her report that she had noticed no reason to suspect the impending incident, nor did she take notice of any magical Imprint in the area, neither before nor immediately following the explosion.

    Local police arrived on scene at 1618 hours. According to our investigations, these officers prioritized the evacuation and rescue of those persons nearest the epicenter of the explosions, followed swiftly by the remainder of the building. They, as well, found no immediate indications as the perpetrator(s) of the attack.

    At 1709 hours, an agency investigatory team headed by Col &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; and consisting otherwise of Sgts &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; and &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; arrived on site, assisting with the investigation being led by local police, including &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, who was stationed in the mall and who affirmed then and later that there had been no known indications found by either routine monitoring of the area, proactive civilian reports, nor by another means. The agency's team affirmed the same, adding that there had been no known intercept of communication that would have led to investigation.

    Security cameras within the mall, as well as those from three adjacent businesses, confirmed that the explosions occurred at precisely 16:11:34 and 16:11:35. All cameras within fifteen (15) meters of the epicenter were destroyed; three further cameras which were aimed at either of the epicenters were only able to indicate that at least one of the charges was set inside one of the building's support pillars. Unfortunately, no persons near the epicenters were able to confirm nor deny any additional details regarding the placement of the explosives, and none of the survivors attested to observing any indications of the imminent explosions, including (but not limited to) any hypothetical warnings made by any other persons.

    Sgt&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; led the post-blast explosives analysis. His testing revealed that the chosen explosive was likely composition C-4 plastic explosive in quantities likely bound between eight (8) and twenty (20) kilograms. Despite his efforts, it was not possible to identify the signature of the explosives, making directly identifying its source impossible. It is known that C-4 is easy and common to detonate remotely, and the investigation found no reason to dispute this hypothesis. However, by the time that radio analysis could be confirmed, there was no way to detect, nor identify, the source of this hypothetical remote detonation. Cross-referencing cellular phone traffic around the time of the explosions found no usable results. It is clear, however, that this explosion could not have been a reasonable accident.

    Further efforts made by Col &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;'s team, as well as those of the local police, led investigations into each of the gang circles within Siel and the neighboring areas. By Fis 02, a larger governmental investigation, also led by Col &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, was initiated and focused on determining and identifying foreign involvement or interference. None was found.

    When no Terran lead was found, two Fae representatives were contacted in the course of the investigation. Their reports, filed Fis 11, affirmed that they had no knowledge of any supernatural involvement, the which was supported by the lack of magical Imprint detected by &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; at the scene.

    The incident has long been branded a terrorist attack by the civilian media, and we have been able to find no other reasonable hypothesis. Though some smaller-scale investigations will continue for the foreseeable future, at the time at which this report is written, full-scale investigations have largely stalled for having exhausted all currently-known investigative leads without success.

    Of further relevant note is that this incident does not closely resemble any known recorded incident in the recent past, nor have any similar incidents been recorded in the month since.
