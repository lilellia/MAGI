    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <p>
        Gwynne is a really sweet girl. She's outgoing, caring, and athletic
        (being a member of her high school's volleyball team). She's at least
        broadly competent at just about anything without trying; her problem is
        that, as soon as she needs to do something and puts in conscious effort,
        she suddenly and utterly (often spectacularly) fails. This gives her a
        very carefree mindset, preferring to attack any and all problems
        head-on without any planning.

            employed by the MCA and was stationed in Siel before her withdrawal from
            the agency. She and Gwynne have only worked together once and have
            only minimal interactions outside of that assignment, maintaining a
            professional colleague/acquaintance-type relationship. Despite having
            succeeded in their mission without major incident, the two simply don't
            work that well together: Minori's general caution and hesitation to
            act, preferring to act on well-formed plans is not generally compatible
            with Gwynne's tendency to act on instinct. However, the two do
            respect each other, each describing the other as highly skilled and
            competent and merely difficult to work with, personally.

    <!-- CURRENT ASSIGNMENT -->
    <h2>Current Assignment</h2>

    <p>
        Gwynne is currently on assignment in Eiria, Turréli. She transferred from
        Kýo High School to Eirian High School at the start of the 7:17:12 school year
        and is expected to graduate from the school at the end of the year, even
        if her assignment should terminate before that.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her assignment is one of long-term undercover infiltration.
