    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <p>
        Aya is a mature, fairly no-nonsense kind of girl. Generally level-headed, she nonetheless can be impatient and
        distant, failing to understand the emotional complexity of a situation. She’s a quick, decisive thinker and
        isn’t afraid to speak her mind about an issue, unconcerned about offending people. If you need an honest,
        to-the-point perspective, she a good person to ask, though be prepared for her somewhat abrasive remarks.
        Despite this, she’s a natural leader, and her skills make up for her rough personality, and she’s generally
        well-liked and respected. When her followers manage to annoy her, she has been known to simply dismiss them and
        take on the problem herself.
    </p>

    <!-- APPEARANCE -->
    <h2>Appearance</h2>

    <p>
        She wears her dark red hair in a drill style, with a small curl framing each side of her face and a single wide
        tress to the middle of her back.
    </p>

    <h3>Gown</h3>
    <p>
        Her Maiden gown is a black V-neck dress with short, frilled sleeves that ends in a ruffle skirt just above her
        knees. A thin amber sash is tied in a bow under her chest.
    </p>

    <h3>High School (Four Years Ago)</h3>
    <p>
        When she was in high school, Aya wore her hair slightly shorter. Her high school uniform was a simple
        yellow/cream blazer with a black skirt.

    <!-- MAIDEN ABILITIES -->
    <h2>Maiden Abilities</h2>

    <p>
        Aya is a broadly well-rounded character, though her true strength is her magic at the slight cost of her
        physical attributes. This explains her preferred use of a bow—a ranged weapon—rather than something like a
        sword. She displays great mastery of spells, specializing in area-of-effect spells, allowing for crowd-control
        that compensates for her avoidance of close-quarters combat. Her archery skills are naturally quite high,
        and she can also loosely control the path of her fired arrows, though doing so requires a large amount of
        concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though a wind Maiden by nature, she also has some basic competence in electric magic. As such, she is one of
        very few Maidens throughout history who have shown proficiency in multiple magical elements.

                    The spell's effect diminishes with range, and she is only able to cast it on people nearby.
                    In addition, maintaining multiple simultaneous instances of the spell's effect is very mentally
                    taxing, and it only creates direct links with Aya and doesn't create a full network between all
                    of the connected nodes. (That is, if Aya is maintaining concurrent links with Minori and Iselle,
                    then there is no link between Minori and Iselle.)

                    more difficult and also incurs a weaker effect, this can be used to aid an ally or defend
                    an area.

            Origin of spell names: Her spell names are largely derived from the <i>Ace Combat</i> video game series, most
            notably from the player squadron's wingmen in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Combat_5:_The_Unsung_War"><i>Ace Combat 5: The Unsung
                    War</i></a>.

            <ul>
                <!-- Urimi -->
                <li>
                    <i>Urimi</i> — from <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Hans_Grimm">Hans Grimm</a>, callsign
                    "Archer", who flies as Wardog/Razgriz 4. In particular, the name comes from Grimm's Japanese name,
                    <ruby>グリム<rp>(</rp>
                        <rt>Gurimu</rt>
                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby>. Since Aya's choice of weapon is a bow, activating her transformation makes
                    her an archer, creating a direct connection to Grimm's callsign.

                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby>, the Japanese name [EN: "Wind's Whisper"] of the finishing burst of <a

                    href="https://youtu.be/1HmMoZUAZvA?t=1667">Wind's Whisper</a>) are not particularly similar in
                    effect: Jess fuses with the Mana of Wind to deal large damage.

                <!-- Ké -->
                <li>
                    <i>Ké</i> — from <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kei_Nagase_(AC5)">Kei Nagase</a>,
                    callsign "Edge", who flies as Wardog/Razgriz 2. The spell's effect of creating sharp guests of
                    wind broadly resembles the slashing of a sword, connecting to Nagase's callsign. This is also a
                    reference to the anime <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girly_Air_Force"><i>Girly Air Force</i></a>, whose main
                    character (also a fighter pilot in a dual lead/supporting role) is named

                    Davenport</a>, callsign "Chopper", who flies as Wardog 3. The spell's effect of pushing things
                    away from her is related to Davenport's callsign, with the blades of a helicopter resembling the
                    blades of a fan.

                    Squadron. In particular, the spell's name comes from the callsign in the Japanese version of the
                    game: AWACS <ruby>サンダーヘッド<rp>(</rp>

                        <rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby>. This reference ties to both Aya's normal wind element (as an <i>Ace Combat</i> reference
                    consistent with her wind-element spells) and her dabbling into electric-element spells (as the word
                    "thunder"&nbsp;&sim;&nbsp;electric). <br /> This spell is also broadly similar to the Pokémon move
                    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Electroweb_(move)">Electroweb</a>.
                </li>

        </li>

        <!-- origin of "fox" -->
        <li>
            The animal component of her callsign, <i>Fox</i>, also refers to the word's use as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_(code_word)">brevity/code word by NATO pilots</a>. In this
            context, it signifies that a pilot has fired a (usually air-to-air) missile. As an archer, her use of a bow
            resembles the firing of a missile.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Her aim is naturally quite good, but because her shots can also be loosely controlled by her magic,
                    the most accurate firing call is "Fox Two", used for infrared-guided missiles.
