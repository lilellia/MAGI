    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <p>
        Having graduated from a prestigious college and attained a position as an assistant to a high-ranking board
        member at a F500 company, she has a sophistication and maturity that her siblings and their peers don’t.
        However, this experience, intelligence, and success have left her dismissive and condescending, both
        underestimating her accomplishments (immediately forgetting or belittling the efforts she put in and thinking
        they ought to be easy to match) and criticizing those who can’t or haven’t yet matched her. She is often seen as
        a bit of a stuck-up bitch, though few dare say that to her face. Combined with the large age gap between them,
        she’s never been close with her younger siblings, though they each look up to and respect her in their own ways,
        often citing that she wasn't quite as bad when she was younger.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Her family name comes from the Russian word <ruby>королева<rp>(</rp>
                <rt>koroleva</rt>
                <rp>)</rp>
            </ruby>, meaning "queen". Though the name is derived as a chained reference for Iselle, it can also be seen
            to apply to Natalia in reference to her general success, status, and condescending nature.
